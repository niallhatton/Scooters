# Zoom Scooters

My project is to support a new business for E-Scooter Fleet management. The business will be deploying E-Scooters around the UK partly in response to COVID-19. UK government wanted a solution to public transport overcrowding and social distancing.

The project is designed to provide information to the public on what we do and why do it. Already there is a negative feeling about the addition of scooters due to the illegal use of personal E-Scooters, we intend to provide the facts and help show how E-Scooters are a good thing for the public. Including the home page I have focused on three pages:

- Home - Here I have given an introduction to what the company does, what we do and where we do it.
- About - This page goes into more detail with an interactive/collapsible FAQ style section to allow the user to read answers to the most common questions we recieve.
- Contact Us - Users have the opportunity to fill out a contact form to send us a message or question and view our contact information.

## UX

The website is aimed at the public so I believe users will be a variety of age ranges. I have also used colours that match the green logo which was chosen to show E-Scooters are are clean alternative to fossil fuel transport options. The navigation bar also features the custom logo. On smaller screens, the navigation links compress behind a toggle button. The purpose of the website is to inform the public about our E-Scooter management services.

Users:

- As a user, I'd like to learn more about what an E-Scooter Fleet Managment company is.
- As a user, I'd like to learn more about the E-Scooters and how they are charged.
- As a user, I'd like to learn more about how E-Scooters are maintained.
- As a user, I'd like to learn more about how E-Scooters are tracked and recovered
- As a user, I'd like to learn more about how E-Scooters are distributed across the cities.
- As a user, I want an easy way to get in touch to ask further questions or send a general message.

**Wireframe Deviation**: Comparison to the wireframes will show that I deviated from the sketches slightly with the content in each section. This is due to a delay in the launch of the business.
- Originally I had planned to already be running the business by the time this project was completed, however due to delays outside my control the launch has not taken place.
- Cities were unconfirmed and important statistics were unavailable. This meant having a section dedicated to statistics did not make sense. 
- I considered doing the wireframes again after the site was completed however I felt this was disingenuous in nature and would not accurately show the true progression of the UX design process. I do feel however the overall UX design intentions were kept and achieved. 

**Navigation**: The navigation bar uses Bootstrap 4 features, responsiveness using a hamburger style button when on smaller devices and includes the custom logo designed for the company. The navigation bar has been used on all pages and is consistant across the site. To give the user an indication of which page they are currently on I have used a green bottom border on the active page.

**Footer**: I have used a simple footer design which has four social Font Awesome icons/links to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. To supplement these I have added the company 0800 phone number and parent company name. The footer is used consistantly across all pages.

**Home page**: I have used a hero/jumbotron with a background image that changes across all three pages to keep interest. The images used are bought and licensed to the company from Adobe stock. The images used are all of E-Scooters in use in a fun, safe and natural manner. Below the hero image there is an introduction section with breif information on the comapany, two further responsive images and a company tagline to reinforce the companies position. Below this I have added a functions section with the companies branded green colour taken from the logo. The function section has the four main task we undertake with a bootstrap button to link to the about us page. Each of the functions uses a Font Awesome icon to reinforce each function. The entire function section uses the Bootstrap grid system for responsiveness and implements two rows and two columns. The cities section is next which displays where the company will deploy E-Scooters and the launch periods intended for each with a Font Awesome icon to complement. The standard footer finishes the page.

**About Us**: Keeping with consistancy the navbar, hero and introduction text section is reused here with alternative text and hero image. In the contrasting green section as seen on also on the home page I have included a collapsible unordered list in a FAQ style. Using Bootstrap 4 grid system, four rows with one function per row, each function has three questions which when clicked expand to show the answer. Each function section also sports the same Font Awesome icon used on the home page. The functions section is well responsive and works well on all devices. The page is finished with the standard footer.

**Contact**: Again navigation bar and hero are reused with alternative hero image. Following this is the contact form created using Bootstrap 4 features, this form is validated using the Code Institute validation tool. It features four form controls, name, email, message and a button. The button is plain as I did not want to over use the green too much. Below the form is a section showing contact information with different styling to ensure good contrast with the green background. The information in this section features clickable links to phone and email. Following this is the cities section as seen on the home page with the standard footer finishing the page.

## Technologies & Services Used

I used the following languages, frameworks, libraries and external services to build this website:

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - HTML5 was used to code the content of the website.
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - CSS3 was used to style the content.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was used to provide a grid structure, navigation toggle effect, navigation links on the Highlights page and multiple other styles by utilising Bootstrap classes such as margins, padding, allignment of text/objects, text decoration, etc.
- [Code Institute Form Validation](https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/) - This form dump was used to validate the form information.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - FontAwesome was used to insert icons into the webpage. These appear in the Home page as function icons and in the footer as the social media links.
- [Logo, FavIcon & Apple Icons](https://www.designcrowd.com/) - Design Crowd was used to source a graphics designer for the logo, favicon and Apple icons.
- [Collapsible list](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-collapsible) - The code example here was used to create the collapsible FAQ section on the About page and then was customised to suit the needs of the site.
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) - The code used was supplied from the Google Analytics dashboard and is specific to this site.

## Testing

### Bugs

The only bug I have found is the margin on the right hand side of the cities section. This was tricky and I was unable to find a fix for this. If I was to develop this project further in the future I would put a lot of time into fixing this. I adjusted margins and paddings and when fixing it on one size screen it would make it worse on others.

### Speed Tests

I ran speed tests on each page using [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/).

Below are screenshots of the tests:

![Home page test](assets/images/speed-tests/home-test.png)
![About Us page test](assets/images/speed-tests/aboutus-test.png)
![Contact page test](assets/images/speed-tests/contact-test.png)

My aim was for all pages to be around 80% on page speed and YSlow scores. All pages were apart from the home page at 79% which I deemed OK.

### Further Tests

1. Home page:

   1. All links tested. Internal links all work. There are no external website links to test but email and telephone links were tested and work on all devices. Telephone correctly will prompt to call on a phone and email opens the default mail client on the device.

## Deployment

This webpage has been deployed to [GitHub pages](https://niallhatton.github.io/Scooters/) for the purposes of the project/learning.

The domain [Zoom Scooters](http://www.zoomscooter.co.uk/) was purchased for this project using [Gandi](http://gandi.net/Gandi), DNS records are also configured here. A sub domain [Zoom Scooters](http://dev.zoomscooter.co.uk/) was used as a staging site with the main domain hosting a holding page while development was taken place.

The site is hosted in Azure cloud on a custom VM I manage. DNS records in [Gandi](http://gandi.net/Gandi) are pointing to the Azure VM public IP address 168.62.210.1.

**Azure VM Specification** 
The VM is a Standard B2s (2 vcpus, 4 GiB memory) running Linux (centos 7.7.1908) the location of this VM is in the West US datacenter. This is because I have other services in that location and it was easier to deploy alongside existing VM's into the same resource group.

**Azure VM Control Panel Software**
[Virtualmin](https://virtualmin.com/) - Open Source Web Hosting and Cloud Control Panels. Virtual hosts/servers have been created for the main domain and the development subdomain.
